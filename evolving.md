<div>Programs comparing the inflow/outflow toy model with the real evolution for each snapshot. They also enable to plot the mass inflow/outflow profiles, the kinetic energy, the log slopes and the coefficiants entering the expression of the kinetic energy according to the Jeans equation. Note that in the example below, the slopes were approximated by linear fits to better smooth the modeled kinetic energy. <br>
